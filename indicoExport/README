Calendar Export from Indico Page

  It will export a .ics file to be added to your calendar app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
pre-requisite
this script uses icalendar pacakge.

https://github.com/collective/icalendar

I added a version in the svn.

  >  gunzip icalendar-2.1.tar.gz
  >  tar xvzf icalendar-2.1.tar
  >  cd icalendar-2.1
  >  sudo python setup.py install # assuming you have root access
  >  cd ../ # go back to indicoExport

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. edit the API_KEY for your account

   obtain the API_KEY and SECRET_KEY from following link:

     https://indico.cern.ch/user/api

   If the keys don't exist yet, create new API key

   then edit the following lines from 'calexport.py'

    API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX' # From the https://indico.cern.ch/user/api/, copy the content in the field "Token"
    SECRET_KEY = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX' # From the https://indico.cern.ch/user/api/, copy the content in the field "Secret"

2. edit filter.py to filter out events only the events you want

   By default when you run calexport.py it will export all events from the ATLAS meetings.
   Most cases that will be too many events. So the filter.py script will filter out events and write
   a new .ics file to be included to your calendar.

   Edit the following

      # ADD YOUR KEYWORDS HERE ---------------------------------------------------------
      # INCLUDE IF THE INDICO MEETING TITLE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING KEYWORD
      includekeyword = [
      "HSG3",
      "HSG6",
      "H to WW",
      "H to WW Editorial Board",
      "Plenary",
      "HH",
      "Higgs Prospects",
      "Invisible",
      "BSM",
      "Neubauer",
      "Illinois",
      ]
      # EXCLUDE IF THE INDICO MEETING TITLE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING KEYWORD
      # I typically like to add a specific title name in order not to exclude wanted events
      excludekeyword = [
      "HSG3 informal: High Mass",
      "H to WW Spin Editorial Board",
      "HSG3 properties meeting"
      ]
      # ADD YOUR KEYWORDS HERE ---------------------------------------------------------

3. run the shell script to run each python script and open the final cal.ics file

  > sh export.sh
